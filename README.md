## Video description
At the top of the video you can see log output of IIoT-System.
There is vibration visualisation in the right corner and live video of the lego prototype in the left corner.<br>

<br>
Timecodes:
* (0:00 — 0:30) start of IIoT-System
* (0:30 — 0:52) response of **identification module** to the lego part without id tag 
* (0:54 — 2:53) production workflow of **defect 1** lego part 
* (1:30 — 1:45) demonstration of predictive maintenance
* (2:56 — 4:40) production workflow of **non-defective** lego part
* (4:45 — 5:00) transport to the **drop zone** the lego part which has already been processed

## Sensor simulators
You can start the docker project with vibration/color sensor simulator(s).
There is more information in the **IIoT-System** folder.
